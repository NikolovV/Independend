/*
 * Chain of responsibility pattern is used to achieve loose coupling in software design
 * where a request from the client is passed to a chain of objects to process them.
 * Then the object in the chain will decide themselves who will be processing the request
 * and whether the request is required to be sent to the next object in the chain or not.
 * Client doesnâ€™t know which part of the chain will be processing the request and
 * it will send the request to the first object in the chain
